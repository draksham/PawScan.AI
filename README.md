** Classification with an Academic **
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a classification model that achieved an accuracy of 83.415%. The project leverages machine learning techniques to classify data, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and robustness.

Project Description
The aim of this project is to build a robust classification model that can accurately predict the target variable from a given dataset. The model utilizes various machine learning techniques and is evaluated on its performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Feature Scaling: RobustScaler is used to scale the features to handle outliers effectively.
Model Training: A CatBoostClassifier is used for training the model with the following parameters:
Iterations: 464
Depth: 6
Learning Rate: 0.09895
L2 Leaf Regularization: 9.98596
Border Count: 37
Random Strength: 0.12604
Bagging Temperature: 0.0578
Early Stopping: 100 rounds
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a test set, achieving an accuracy of 83.415%.
Results
The classification model achieved an accuracy of 83.415% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness and reliability. The high accuracy demonstrates the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

PointFusion: Deep Sensor Fusion for 3D Bounding Box Estimation
Overview
PointFusion is a generic 3D object detection method that leverages both image and 3D point cloud information. Unlike existing methods that use multi-stage pipelines or hold sensor and dataset-specific assumptions, PointFusion is conceptually simple and application-agnostic.

Key Features
Image and Point Cloud Fusion: Combines image data processed by a CNN and point cloud data processed by a PointNet architecture.
Novel Fusion Network: Predicts multiple 3D box hypotheses and their confidences using the input 3D points as spatial anchors.
Application-Agnostic: Performs well on diverse datasets without any dataset-specific model tuning.

Datasets
PointFusion is evaluated on two distinctive datasets:

KITTI Dataset: Features driving scenes captured with a lidar-camera setup.
SUN-RGBD Dataset: Captures indoor environments with RGB-D cameras.
Performance
PointFusion is the first model to perform better or on-par with the state-of-the-art on these diverse datasets without any dataset-specific model tuning.
